# Stock-Trading-News-Alert-Project

I developed a Stock Trading News Alert System using Python and APIs. It provides real-time stock price and news updates via SMS alerts. The system integrates stock and news APIs to fetch data, parses responses, and extracts relevant information. Alerts are sent using the Twilio API. Error handling, logging, and scheduling mechanisms were implemented. The project demonstrates my Python skills, API integration, and delivering real-time information for informed stock trading decisions.
